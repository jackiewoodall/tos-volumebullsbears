# VolumeBullsBears

A ThinkOrSwim script (thinkscript) volume indictor which renders an estimated number of contracts/shares bought vs sold. For a given time slice of an asset, the contracts bought are rendered in green while the number of contracts sold are rendered in red.

## Options:

* FixedScale: `Unscaled` by default to render the full volume range. Changing to `Scaled` will limit the range from 0 to 100.
